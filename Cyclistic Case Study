-- I want to look at a few things


-- Using the code below, I was able in the FROM subquery to take into account other variables that might be needed
-- I was also previously able to identify where the null values are in the data set and what kind of consistency issues we might face
-- Thankfully, most string values were consistent and non-null. However, the station id and names (starting and ending stations) needed to be accounted for
-- At first, I wanted to know how long do most people use their bikes. This will give me insight into rider behaviour

 -- More analysis can be done to find more correlations
